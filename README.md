# chatBot
Mashup of the SDK for ChatGPT from OpenAI and Transcribe + Polly from AWS to create a way to chat with ChatGPT using voice. Originally created as a way to give my son a chatty friend which was powered by ChatGPT. Now it is set to translate English to Japanese by default but can easily be changed. The current version doesn't save chat state.
